Two weeks back, I decided to change my life.  
I wanted to stop overthinking and start building — skills, confidence, and momentum.

It’s a one-month **“1M Plan”** where I learn the foundations of **market systems and data analysis** while coding with **Rust**.

But truth be told, Week 1 took me two weeks. Not because it was complex — but because I was inconsistent.

My discipline is weak, my eyes strain easily, and I often lose focus. Some days I just couldn’t look at the screen.

The U.S. job market stress didn’t help either. The pressure of “not doing enough” made me spiral into doing nothing.

Still, I reminded myself — *slow progress &gt; no progress.*  
And I made it through Week 1.

Here’s what I learned.

### 📘 Order Books, Bid–Ask & Liquidity

**Definition:**  
An order book is a real-time list of all buy (bid) and sell (ask) intents for an asset or instrument.

The bid shows what people are willing to pay, the ask shows what they want to receive.  
The gap between them — the *spread* — reflects activity and flow.

**What I understood:**  
The order book felt like the heartbeat of a system.  
A narrow spread means energy — constant movement.  
A wide one feels uncertain.

Liquidity is how easily something moves without shaking the price — deep books flow smoothly, thin ones ripple.

Good liquidity felt like water: the more there is, the easier it is to swim.

---

### 💸 Slippage

**Definition:**  
Slippage is the difference between the price you expect and the one you actually get when an order executes.

**Two ways to view it:**

| View | Description | Cause |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Price-based | Difference between expected and actual execution price | Sudden changes or latency |
| Depth-based | Your request “consumes” several price levels, changing the average fill | Low liquidity / thin book |

**What I understood:**  
Slippage happens when you act faster than the system can respond.  
It’s like asking for ten mangoes at ₹100 each — only five are available; the rest cost ₹105.  
Impatience raises your average cost.

---

### 🧾 Market, Limit & Stop Orders

* **Market** → executes immediately at the best available level.
    
* **Limit** → executes only at your chosen threshold.
    
* **Stop** → activates automatically when a certain trigger is hit.
    

Stop orders felt like seatbelts — unnoticed when all goes well, life-saving when things go wrong.

### 📊 Moving Averages (MA): SMA, EMA & Crossovers

**Definition:**  
A Moving Average smooths out short-term noise to reveal the underlying direction.

**1️⃣ Simple Moving Average (SMA)**  
Average of closing prices over a set period.

**What I understood:**  
MAs are like calm teachers summarizing chaos — short ones react fast but noisy; long ones react slow but steady.

```rust
fn simple_moving_average(prices: &[f64], period: usize) -> Option<f64> {
    if prices.len() < period {
        return None;
    }
    let sum: f64 = prices[prices.len() - period..].iter().sum();
    Some(sum / period as f64)
}

fn main() {
    let values = vec![64000.0, 64200.0, 63950.0, 64100.0, 64300.0];
    if let Some(sma) = simple_moving_average(&values, 3) {
        println!("3-day SMA: {:.2}", sma);
    } else {
        println!("Not enough data");
    }
}
```

Rust made it elegant and safe — numbers turning into insight.

**2️⃣ Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**  
EMA reacts faster to recent changes.  
If SMA is a steady teacher, EMA is the student noticing today’s mood.

**3️⃣ Crossovers**  
When a short-term MA crosses a long-term MA, it hints at trend shifts — like momentum traffic lights: green to go, red to slow.

---

### 📉 RSI & MACD

**RSI (Relative Strength Index):**  
Shows when a system is over-energized or exhausted.  
Helps avoid reacting to hype or fear.

**MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):**  
Tracks the difference between two EMAs and their momentum.  
When the gap widens or flips, momentum changes direction.

It felt like watching heartbeat spikes of movement — subtle, rhythmic, revealing.

---

### 🛡️ Risk Thinking

**Definition:**  
Risk thinking means protecting your base while experimenting for growth.  
It includes sizing, exits, and assessing whether something is worth acting on.

**What I understood:**  
It felt like cricket — you can’t play cover drives every ball.  
It’s not about big shots; it’s about staying at the crease.  
Defense keeps you in the game.

### ⚙️ Fetching Live Price Data (REST API + Rust)

Using the `reqwest` crate, I fetched real-time asset data from a public API:

```rust
use reqwest;
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct PriceData {
    amount: String,
    base: String,
    currency: String,
}

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct ApiResponse {
    data: PriceData,
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let resp = reqwest::get("https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/BTC-USD/spot")
        .await?
        .json::<ApiResponse>()
        .await?;
    println!("{}: ${}", resp.data.base, resp.data.amount);
    Ok(())
}
```

It felt like touching a live data stream — Rust handled it cleanly and safely.

---

### 🧰 Building a CLI Tool

After that, I built a small **CLI tool** to print live asset prices from APIs.  
Simple input → instant output.

🔗 [GitHub Repo – crypto-price-fetcher](https://github.com/noworry-b-still/crypto-price-fetcher)

Small tools compound learning — this was my first step into **data automation**, not finance.

### 🦀 Rustlings Progress

Alongside this, I continued **Rustlings** exercises up to lifetimes.  
At first, the compiler felt harsh — now it feels like a mentor stopping me from breaking things.

Lifetimes teach patience — every reference has a story.  
Rust makes you reason about memory like a strategist — careful, precise, intentional.

### 🧠 Reflection

This week taught me two truths:

* Systems reward discipline.
    
* Rust rewards clarity.
    

Both punish carelessness.

I may be slow, but I’m building something solid — one concept, one line, one step at a time.
